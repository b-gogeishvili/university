Object Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm. It is focused on objects
and data, instead of algorithms and functions.

OOP consists of: Classes, Objects, Attributes, Methods.

# Key Concepts

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is a principle that hides the implementation details
of object from outside. Attributes and Methods are restricted from 
external access. 

### Abstraction

Abstraction is a principle that focus on system's essential elements
and ignore less important details that have no effect on its key features.
It helps us construct more understandable programs.

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows us to have methods that behave differently. This means that,
we can have several methods with the same name, and they can behave differently
depending the type of object we are operating on.

### Inheritance

With Inheritance, we are able to create new classes based on existing classes,
with options of overriding or augmenting thier properties and methods.
